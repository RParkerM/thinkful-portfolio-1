          <h3>About Parker</h3>
          <p>
            During my college career, I worked in restaurants to fund my
            education. In this time, I enjoyed the opportunity to work with
            professionals and also mentor young leaders. I've gained many skills
            through this experience, and I also learned that I loved creating
            digital tools to improve my businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm using my time as a student at
            <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>

            to propel my software development career to new heights, and I'm so
            excited for this journey!
          </p>
          <p>
            During my free time, I enjoy playing board games and card games with
            my family and friends. We often struggle to pick which game to play,
            because we enjoy so many of them!
          </p>

            If you're looking to hire a developer, or looking for a partner for
